+   *   This will require condition to be satisfied on a specific delta of the

+   *   match the provided value. Further, it's possible to create a condition on

+   *   @code
+   *   ->condition('tags.%delta', 5)
+   *   @endcode
+   *   will find only entities which have at least six tags. Finally, the

+   *   ->condition('tags.%delta', 0, '>'))
+   *   ->condition('tags.%delta.value', 'news'))
+   *   @endcode
+   *   will only find the "news" tag if it is not the first value. It should be
