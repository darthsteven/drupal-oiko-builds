description: "<p>This class comprises quantifiable properties that can be measured by some calibrated means\r\nand can be approximated by values, i.e. points or regions in a mathematical or conceptual\r\nspace, such as natural or real numbers, RGB values etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An instance of E54 Dimension represents the true quantity, independent from its numerical\r\napproximation, e.g. in inches or in cm. The properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for\r\nexpressing the numerical approximation of the values of an instance of E54 Dimension. If the\r\ntrue values belong to a non-discrete space, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to\r\nrecord them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed\r\ntrue values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the\r\nprecision of the respective observation. Note, that interoperability of values described in\r\ndifferent units depends critically on the representation as value regions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Numerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical\r\nrecords should be preserved. Equivalents corresponding to current knowledge should be\r\nrecorded as additional instances of E54 Dimension as appropriate.</p>\r\n"
