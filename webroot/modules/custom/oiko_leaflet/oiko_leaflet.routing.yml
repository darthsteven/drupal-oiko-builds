# In order to to create pages it is necessary to define routes for them.
# A route maps a URL path to a controller. It defines what function
# or method will be called when a URL is accessed.
# If the user accesses http://drupal8.dev//cidoc-entity/{cidoc_entity}/popup, the routing
# system will look for a route with that path. In this case it will find a
# match, and execute the _controller callback. In this case the callback is
# defined as a classname
# ("\Drupal\oiko_leaflet\Controller\PopupContentController")
# and a method ("view").
oiko_leaflet.popup_content_controller_view:
  path: '/cidoc-entity/{cidoc_entity}/popup'

    _controller: '\Drupal\oiko_leaflet\Controller\PopupContentController::view'
    _title: 'cidocCRMPopupConent'
