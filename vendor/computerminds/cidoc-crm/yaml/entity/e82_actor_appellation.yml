label: E82 Actor Appellation
superclasses:
  - e41_appellation
description: |
  This class comprises any sort of name, number, code or symbol characteristically used to
  identify an E39 Actor.

  An E39 Actor will typically have more than one E82 Actor Appellation, and instances of E82
  Actor Appellation in turn may have alternative representations. The distinction between
  corporate and personal names, which is particularly important in library applications, should
  be made by explicitly linking the E82 Actor Appellation to an instance of either E21 Person or
  E74 Group/E40 Legal Body. If this is not possible, the distinction can be made through the use
  of the P2 has type mechanism.
