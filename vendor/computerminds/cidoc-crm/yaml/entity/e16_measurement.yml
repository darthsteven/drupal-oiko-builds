description: |
  This class comprises actions measuring physical properties and other values that can be
  determined by a systematic procedure.

  Examples include measuring the monetary value of a collection of coins or the running time of
  a specific video cassette.

  The E16 Measurement may use simple counting or tools, such as yardsticks or radiation
  detection devices. The interest is in the method and care applied, so that the reliability of the
  result may be judged at a later stage, or research continued on the associated documents. The
  date of the event is important for dimensions, which may change value over time, such as the
  length of an object subject to shrinkage. Details of methods and devices are best handled as
  free text, whereas basic techniques such as "carbon 14 dating" should be encoded using P2 has
  type (is type of:) E55 Type.

  * the carbon 14 dating of the “Schoeninger Speer II” in 1996 [an about 400.000 years old
    Palaeolithic complete wooden spear found in Schoeningen, Niedersachsen, Germany in
    1995]
