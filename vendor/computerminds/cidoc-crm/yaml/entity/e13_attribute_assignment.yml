description: |
  This class comprises the actions of making assertions about properties of an object or any
  relation between two items or concepts.

  This class allows the documentation of how the respective assignment came about, and whose
  opinion it was. All the attributes or properties assigned in such an action can also be seen as
  directly attached to the respective item or concept, possibly as a collection of contradictory
  values. All cases of properties in this model that are also described indirectly through an action
  are characterised as "short cuts" of this action. This redundant modelling of two alternative
  views is preferred because many implementations may have good reasons to model either the
  action or the short cut, and the relation between both alternatives can be captured by simple
  rules.

  In particular, the class describes the actions of people making propositions and statements
  during certain museum procedures, e.g. the person and date when a condition statement was
  made, an identifier was assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such
  assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in structures of a schema rather
  than free text, depends on if this information should be accessible by structured queries.
