label: E38 Image
superclasses:
  - e36_visual_item
description: |
  This class comprises distributions of form, tone and colour that may be found on surfaces such
  as photos, paintings, prints and sculptures or directly on electronic media.

  The degree to which variations in the distribution of form and colour affect the identity of an
  instance of E38 Image depends on a given purpose. The original painting of the Mona Lisa in
  the Louvre may be said to bear the same instance of E38 Image as reproductions in the form of
  transparencies, postcards, posters or T-shirts, even though they may differ in size and carrier
  and may vary in tone and colour. The images in a “spot the difference” competition are not the
  same with respect to their context, however similar they may at first appear.
