label: E64 End of Existence
superclasses:
  - e5_event
properties:
  - p93_took_out_of_existence
description: |
  This class comprises events that end the existence of any E77 Persistent Item.

  It may be used for temporal reasoning about things (physical items, groups of people, living
  beings) ceasing to exist; it serves as a hook for determination of a terminus postquem and
  antequem. In cases where substance from a Persistent Item continues to exist in a new form,
  the process would be documented by E81 Transformation.
examples: |
  * the death of Snoopy, my dog
  * the melting of the snowman
  * the burning of the Temple of Artemis in Ephesos by Herostratos in 356BC
