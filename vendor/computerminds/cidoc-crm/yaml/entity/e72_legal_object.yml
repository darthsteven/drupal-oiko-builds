superclasses:
  - e70_thing
properties:
  - p104_is_subject_to

description: |
  This class comprises those material or immaterial items to which instances of E30 Right, such
  as the right of ownership or use, can be applied.

  This is true for all E18 Physical Thing. In the case of instances of E28 Conceptual Object,
  however, the identity of the E28 Conceptual Object or the method of its use may be too
  ambiguous to reliably establish instances of E30 Right, as in the case of taxa and inspirations.
  Ownership of corporations is currently regarded as out of scope of the CRM.
