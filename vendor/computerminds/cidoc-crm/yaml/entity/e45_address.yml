label: E45 Address
superclasses:
  - e44_place_appellation
  - e51_contact_point
description: |
  This class comprises identifiers expressed in coding systems for places, such as postal
  addresses used for mailing.

  An E45 Address can be considered both as the name of an E53 Place and as an E51 Contact
  Point for an E39 Actor. This dual aspect is reflected in the multiple inheritance. However,
  some forms of mailing addresses, such as a postal box, are only instances of E51 Contact
  Point, since they do not identify any particular Place. These should not be documented as
  instances of E45 Address.
