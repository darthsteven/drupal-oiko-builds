label: E46 Section Definition
superclasses:
  - e44_place_appellation
description: |
  This class comprises areas of objects referred to in terms specific to the general geometry or
  structure of its kind.

  The 'prow' of the boat, the 'frame' of the picture, the 'front' of the building are all instances of
  E46 Section Definition. The class highlights the fact that parts of objects can be treated as
  locations. This holds in particular for features without natural boundaries, such as the “head”
  of a marble statue made out of one block (cf. E53 Place). In answer to the question 'where is
  the signature?' one might reply 'on the lower left corner'. (Section Definition is closely related
  to the term “segment” in Gerstl, P.& Pribbenow, S, 1996 “ A conceptual theory of part – whole
  relations and its applications”, Data & Knowledge Engineering 20 305-322, North HollandElsevier
  ).
