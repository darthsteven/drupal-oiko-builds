  This class comprises changes of states in cultural, social or physical systems, regardless of
  scale, brought about by a series or group of coherent physical, cultural, technological or legal
  phenomena. Such changes of state will affect instances of E77 Persistent Item or its subclasses.

  The distinction between an E5 Event and an E4 Period is partly a question of the scale of
  observation. Viewed at a coarse level of detail, an E5 Event is an ‘instantaneous’ change of
  state. At a fine level, the E5 Event can be analysed into its component phenomena within a
  space and time frame, and as such can be seen as an E4 Period. The reverse is not necessarily
  the case: not all instances of E4 Period give rise to a noteworthy change of state.
