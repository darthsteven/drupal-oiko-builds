description: |
  This class comprises the names assigned to works, such as texts, artworks or pieces of music.

  Titles are proper noun phrases or verbal phrases, and should not be confused with generic
  object names such as “chair”, “painting” or “book” (the latter are common nouns that stand for
  instances of E55 Type). Titles may be assigned by the creator of the work itself, or by a social
  group.

  This class also comprises the translations of titles that are used as surrogates for the original
  titles in different social contexts.

  * “The Merchant of Venice”

  * “La Pie or The Magpie”
  * “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds”
