description: |
  This class comprises abstract temporal extents, in the sense of Galilean physics, having a
  beginning, an end and a duration.

  Time Span has no other semantic connotations. Time-Spans are used to define the temporal
  extent of instances of E4 Period, E5 Event and any other phenomena valid for a certain time.
  An E52 Time-Span may be identified by one or more instances of E49 Time Appellation.

  Since our knowledge of history is imperfect, instances of E52 Time-Span can best be
  considered as approximations of the actual Time-Spans of temporal entities. The properties of
  E52 Time-Span are intended to allow these approximations to be expressed precisely. An
  extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an E52 Time-Span having
  unknown beginning, end and duration. Used as a common E52 Time-Span for two events, it
  would nevertheless define them as being simultaneous, even if nothing else was known.

  Automatic processing and querying of instances of E52 Time-Span is facilitated if data can be
  parsed into an E61 Time Primitive.
