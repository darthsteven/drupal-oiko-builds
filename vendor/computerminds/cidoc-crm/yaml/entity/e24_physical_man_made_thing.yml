description: |
  This class comprises all persistent physical items that are purposely created by human activity.

  This class comprises man-made objects, such as a swords, and man-made features, such as
  rock art. No assumptions are made as to the extent of modification required to justify regarding
  an object as man-made. For example, a “cup and ring” carving on bedrock is regarded as
  instance of E24 Physical Man-Made Thing.
