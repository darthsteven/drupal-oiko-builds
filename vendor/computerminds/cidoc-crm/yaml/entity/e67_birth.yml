description: |
  This class comprises the births of human beings. E67 Birth is a biological event focussing on
  the context of people coming into life. (E63 Beginning of Existence comprises the coming into
  life of any living beings).

  Twins, triplets etc. are brought into life by the same E67 Birth event. The introduction of the
  E67 Birth event as a documentation element allows the description of a range of family
  relationships in a simple model. Suitable extensions may describe more details and the
  complexity of motherhood with the intervention of modern medicine. In this model, the
  biological father is not seen as a necessary participant in the E67 Birth event.
