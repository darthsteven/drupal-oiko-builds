  This class comprises the states of objects characterised by a certain condition over a time-span.

  An instance of this class describes the prevailing physical condition of any material object or
  feature during a specific E52 Time Span. In general, the time-span for which a certain
  condition can be asserted may be shorter than the real time-span, for which this condition held.
  The nature of that condition can be described using P2 has type. For example, the E3
  Condition State “condition of the SS Great Britain between 22 September 1846 and 27 August
  1847” can be characterized as E55 Type “wrecked”.
