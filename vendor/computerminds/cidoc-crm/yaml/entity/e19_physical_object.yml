description: |
  This class comprises items of a material nature that are units for documentation and have
  physical boundaries that separate them completely in an objective way from other objects.

  The class also includes all aggregates of objects made for functional purposes of whatever
  kind, independent of physical coherence, such as a set of chessmen. Typically, instances of
  E19 Physical Object can be moved (if not too heavy).

  In some contexts, such objects, except for aggregates, are also called “bona fide objects”
  (Smith & Varzi, 2000, pp.401-420), i.e. naturally defined objects.

  The decision as to what is documented as a complete item, rather than by its parts or
  components, may be a purely administrative decision or may be a result of the order in which
  the item was acquired.
