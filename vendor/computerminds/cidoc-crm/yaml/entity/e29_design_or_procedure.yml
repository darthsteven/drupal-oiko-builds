description: |
  This class comprises documented plans for the execution of actions in order to achieve a result
  of a specific quality, form or contents. In particular it comprises plans for deliberate human
  activities that may result in the modification or production of instances of E24 Physical Thing.

  Instances of E29 Design or Procedure can be structured in parts and sequences or depend on
  others. This is modelled using P69 is associated with.

  Designs or procedures can be seen as one of the following:

  1. A schema for the activities it describes
  2. A schema of the products that result from their application.
  3. An independent intellectual product that may have never been applied, such as Leonardo
     da Vinci’s famous plans for flying machines.

  Because designs or procedures may never be applied or only partially executed, the CRM
  models a loose relationship between the plan and the respective product.
