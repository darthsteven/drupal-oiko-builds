description: |
  This class comprises the intellectual or conceptual aspects of recognisable marks and images.

  This class does not intend to describe the idiosyncratic characteristics of an individual physical
  embodiment of a visual item, but the underlying prototype. For example, a mark such as the
  ICOM logo is generally considered to be the same logo when used on any number of
  publications. The size, orientation and colour may change, but the logo remains uniquely
  identifiable. The same is true of images that are reproduced many times. This means that visual
  items are independent of their physical support.

  The class E36 Visual Item provides a means of identifying and linking together instances of
  E24 Physical Man-Made Thing that carry the same visual symbols, marks or images etc. The
  property P62 depicts (is depicted by) between E24 Physical Man-Made Thing and depicted
  subjects (E1 CRM Entity) can be regarded as a short-cut of the more fully developed path from
  E24 Physical Man-Made Thing through P65 shows visual item (is shown by), E36 Visual Item,
  P138 represents (has representation) to E1CRM Entity, which in addition captures the optical
  features of the depiction.
