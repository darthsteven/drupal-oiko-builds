description: |
  This class comprises the activities that result in an instance of E18 Physical Thing being
  decreased by the removal of a part.

  Typical scenarios include the detachment of an accessory, the removal of a component or part
  of a composite object, or the deaccessioning of an object from a curated E78 Collection. If the
  E80 Part Removal results in the total decomposition of the original object into pieces, such that
  the whole ceases to exist, the activity should instead be modelled as an E81 Transformation,
  i.e. a simultaneous destruction and production. In cases where the part removed has no
  discernible identity prior to its removal but does have an identity subsequent to its removal, the
  activity should be regarded as both E80 Part Removal and E12 Production. This class of
  activities forms a basis for reasoning about the history, and continuity of identity over time, of
  objects that are removed from other objects, such as precious gemstones being extracted from
  different items of jewelry, or cultural artifacts being deaccessioned from different museum
  collections over their lifespan.
