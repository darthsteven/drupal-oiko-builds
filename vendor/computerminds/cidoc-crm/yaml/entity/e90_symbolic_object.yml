description: |
  This class comprises identifiable symbols and any aggregation of symbols, such as characters,
  identifiers, traffic signs, emblems, texts, data sets, images, musical scores, multimedia objects,
  computer program code or mathematical formulae that have an objectively recognizable
  structure and that are documented as single units.

  It includes sets of signs of any nature, which may serve to designate something, or to
  communicate some propositional content.

  An instance of E90 Symbolic Object does not depend on a specific physical carrier, which can
  include human memory, and it can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously. An instance
  of E90 Symbolic Object may or may not have a specific meaning, for example an arbitrary
  character string.
