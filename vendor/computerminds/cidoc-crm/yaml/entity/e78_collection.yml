description: |
  This class comprises aggregations of instances of E18 Physical Thing that are assembled and
  maintained (“curated” and “preserved,” in museological terminology) by one or more instances
  of E39 Actor over time for a specific purpose and audience, and according to a particular
  collection development plan.

  Items may be added or removed from an E78 Collection in pursuit of this plan. This class
  Definition of the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model 31
  should not be confused with the E39 Actor maintaining the E78 Collection often referred to
  with the name of the E78 Collection (e.g. “The Wallace Collection decided…”).

  Collective objects in the general sense, like a tomb full of gifts, a folder with stamps or a set of
  chessmen, should be documented as instances of E19 Physical Object, and not as instances of
  E78 Collection. This is because they form wholes either because they are physically bound
  together or because they are kept together for their functionality.
