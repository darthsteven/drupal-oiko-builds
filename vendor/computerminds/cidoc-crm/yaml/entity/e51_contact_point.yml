description: |
  This class comprises identifiers employed, or understood, by communication services to direct
  communications to an instance of E39 Actor. These include E-mail addresses, telephone
  numbers, post office boxes, Fax numbers, URLs etc. Most postal addresses can be considered
  both as instances of E44 Place Appellation and E51 Contact Point. In such cases the subclass
  E45 Address should be used.
  URLs are addresses used by machines to access another machine through an http request.
  Since the accessed machine acts on behalf of the E39 Actor providing the machine, URLs are
  considered as instances of E51 Contact Point to that E39 Actor.
