description: |
  This class comprises activities that result in an instance of E24 Physical Man-Made Thing
  being increased, enlarged or augmented by the addition of a part.

  Typical scenarios include the attachment of an accessory, the integration of a component, the
  addition of an element to an aggregate object, or the accessioning of an object into a curated
  E78 Collection. Objects to which parts are added are, by definition, man-made, since the
  addition of a part implies a human activity. Following the addition of parts, the resulting manmade
  assemblages are treated objectively as single identifiable wholes, made up of constituent
  or component parts bound together either physically (for example the engine becoming a part
  of the car), or by sharing a common purpose (such as the 32 chess pieces that make up a chess
  set). This class of activities forms a basis for reasoning about the history and continuity of
  identity of objects that are integrated into other objects over time, such as precious gemstones
  being repeatedly incorporated into different items of jewellery, or cultural artifacts being added
  to different museum instances of E78 Collection over their lifespan.
