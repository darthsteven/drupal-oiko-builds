description: |
  This class comprises activities formally defining new types of items.

  It is typically a rigorous scholarly or scientific process that ensures a type is exhaustively
  described and appropriately named. In some cases, particularly in archaeology and the life
  sciences, E83 Type Creation requires the identification of an exemplary specimen and the
  publication of the type definition in an appropriate scholarly forum. The activity of E83 Type
  Creation is central to research in the life sciences, where a type would be referred to as a
  “taxon,” the type description as a “protologue,” and the exemplary specimens as “orgininal
  element” or “holotype”.
