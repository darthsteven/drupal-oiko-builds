description: |
  This class comprises the actions of classifying items of whatever kind. Such items include
  objects, specimens, people, actions and concepts.

  This class allows for the documentation of the context of classification acts in cases where the
  value of the classification depends on the personal opinion of the classifier, and the date that
  the classification was made. This class also encompasses the notion of "determination," i.e. the
  systematic and molecular identification of a specimen in biology.

  * the first classification of object GE34604 as Lament Cloth, October 2nd
  * the determination of a cactus in Martin Doerr’s garden as ‘Cereus hildmannianus
