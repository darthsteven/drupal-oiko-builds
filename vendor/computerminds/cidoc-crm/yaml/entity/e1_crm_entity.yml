description: |
  This class comprises all things in the universe of discourse of the CIDOC Conceptual
  Reference Model.

  It is an abstract concept providing for three general properties:
  1. Identification by name or appellation, and in particular by a preferred identifier
  2. Classification by type, allowing further refinement of the specific subclass an instance
     belongs to
  3. Attachment of free text for the expression of anything not captured by formal properties

  With the exception of E59 Primitive Value, all other classes within the CRM are directly or
  indirectly specialisations of E1 CRM Entity.
