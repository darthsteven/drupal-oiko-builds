description: |
  This class comprises people, either individually or in groups, who have the potential to
  perform intentional actions for which they can be held responsible.

  The CRM does not attempt to model the inadvertent actions of such actors. Individual people
  should be documented as instances of E21 Person, whereas groups should be documented as
  instances of either E74 Group or its subclass E40 Legal Body.
examples: |
  * London and Continental Railways (E40)
  * the Governor of the Bank of England in 1975 (E21)
  * Sir Ian McKellan (E21)
