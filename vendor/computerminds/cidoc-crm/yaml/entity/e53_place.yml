  This class comprises extents in space, in particular on the surface of the earth, in the pure sense
  of physics: independent from temporal phenomena and matter.

  The instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of “immobile”
  objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks. A Place can
  be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It
  may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.

  It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or
  absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context
  of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in
  position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which
  Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of
  this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the
  vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack
  historical and cultural relevance.

  Any object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees
  the notion of a "section" of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination.
