description: |
  This class comprises immaterial items, including but not limited to stories, plots, procedural
  prescriptions, algorithms, laws of physics or images that are, or represent in some sense, sets of
  propositions about real or imaginary things and that are documented as single units or serve as
  topic of discourse.

  This class also comprises items that are “about” something in the sense of a subject. In the
  wider sense, this class includes expressions of psychological value such as non-figural art and
  musical themes. However, conceptual items such as types and classes are not instances of E89
  Propositional Object. This should not be confused with the definition of a type, which is
  indeed an instance of E89 Propositional Object.
