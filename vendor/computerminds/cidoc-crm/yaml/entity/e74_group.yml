description: |
  This class comprises any gatherings or organizations of two or more people that act
  collectively or in a similar way due to any form of unifying relationship. In the wider sense
  this class also comprises official positions which used to be regarded in certain contexts as
  one actor, independent of the current holder of the office, such as the president of a country.

  A gathering of people becomes an E74 Group when it exhibits organizational characteristics
  usually typified by a set of ideas or beliefs held in common, or actions performed together.
  These might be communication, creating some common artifact, a common purpose such as
  study, worship, business, sports, etc. Nationality can be modeled as membership in an E74
  Group (cf. HumanML markup). Married couples and other concepts of family are regarded as
  particular examples of E74 Group.
