description: |
  This class comprises identifiable immaterial items, such as a poems, jokes, data sets, images,
  texts, multimedia objects, procedural prescriptions, computer program code, algorithm or
  mathematical formulae, that have an objectively recognizable structure and are documented as
  single units.

  An E73 Information Object does not depend on a specific physical carrier, which can include
  human memory, and it can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously.
  Instances of E73 Information Object of a linguistic nature should be declared as instances of
  the E33 Linguistic Object subclass. Instances of E73 Information Object of a documentary
  nature should be declared as instances of the E31 Document subclass. Conceptual items such
  as types and classes are not instances of E73 Information Object, nor are ideas without a
  reproducible expression.
