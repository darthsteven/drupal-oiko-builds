description: |
  This class comprises events that result in the formation of a formal or informal E74 Group of
  people, such as a club, society, association, corporation or nation.

  E66 Formation does not include the arbitrary aggregation of people who do not act as a
  collective.
  The formation of an instance of E74 Group does not mean that the group is populated with
  members at the time of formation. In order to express the joining of members at the time of
  formation, the respective activity should be simultaneously an instance of both E66 Formation
  and E85 Joining.
