label: E54 Dimension
superclasses:
  - e1_crm_entity
properties:
  - p90_has_value
  - p91_has_unit
description: |
  This class comprises quantifiable properties that can be measured by some calibrated means
  and can be approximated by values, i.e. points or regions in a mathematical or conceptual
  space, such as natural or real numbers, RGB values etc.

  An instance of E54 Dimension represents the true quantity, independent from its numerical
  approximation, e.g. in inches or in cm. The properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for
  expressing the numerical approximation of the values of an instance of E54 Dimension. If the
  true values belong to a non-discrete space, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to
  record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed
  true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the
  precision of the respective observation. Note, that interoperability of values described in
  different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.

  Numerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical
  records should be preserved. Equivalents corresponding to current knowledge should be
  recorded as additional instances of E54 Dimension as appropriate.
