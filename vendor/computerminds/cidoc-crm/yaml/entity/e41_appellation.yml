description: |
  This class comprises all sequences of signs of any nature, either meaningful or not, that are
  used or can be used to refer to and identify a specific instance of some class within a certain
  context.

  Instances of E41 Appellation do not identify things by their meaning, even if they happen to
  have one, but by convention, tradition, or agreement. Instances of E41 Appellation are cultural
  constructs; as such, they have a context, a history, and a use in time and space by some group
  of users. A given instance of E41 Appellation can have alternative forms, i.e., other instances
  of E41 Appellation that are always regarded as equivalent independent from the thing it
  denotes.

  Specific subclasses of E41 Appellation should be used when instances of E41 Appellation of a
  characteristic form are used for particular objects. Instances of E49 Time Appellation, for
  example, which take the form of instances of E50 Date, can be easily recognised.

  E41 Appellation should not be confused with the act of naming something. Cf. E15 Identifier
