label: E60 Number
superclasses:
  - e59_primitive_value
description: |
  This class comprises any encoding of computable (algebraic) values such as integers, real
  numbers, complex numbers, vectors, tensors etc., including intervals of these values to express
  limited precision.

  Numbers are fundamentally distinct from identifiers in continua, such as instances of E50 Date
  and E47 Spatial Coordinate, even though their encoding may be similar. Instances of E60
  Number can be combined with each other in algebraic operations to yield other instances of
  E60 Number, e.g., 1+1=2. Identifiers in continua may be combined with numbers expressing
  distances to yield new identifiers, e.g., 1924-01-31 + 2 days = 1924-02-02. Cf. E54 Dimension
