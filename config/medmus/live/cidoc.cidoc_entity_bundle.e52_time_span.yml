description: "<p>This class comprises abstract temporal extents, in the sense of Galilean physics, having a\nbeginning, an end and a duration.</p>\n\n<p>Time Span has no other semantic connotations. Time-Spans are used to define the temporal\nextent of instances of E4 Period, E5 Event and any other phenomena valid for a certain time.\nAn E52 Time-Span may be identified by one or more instances of E49 Time Appellation.</p>\n\n<p>Since our knowledge of history is imperfect, instances of E52 Time-Span can best be\nconsidered as approximations of the actual Time-Spans of temporal entities. The properties of\nE52 Time-Span are intended to allow these approximations to be expressed precisely. An\nextreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an E52 Time-Span having\nunknown beginning, end and duration. Used as a common E52 Time-Span for two events, it\nwould nevertheless define them as being simultaneous, even if nothing else was known.</p>\n\n<p>Automatic processing and querying of instances of E52 Time-Span is facilitated if data can be\nparsed into an E61 Time Primitive.</p>\n"
